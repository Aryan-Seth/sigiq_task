Throughout high school, I had always excelled in academics. My mother is a college professor and my father is a teacher, so learning was instilled in me at a very young age. During my junior year (a monumental year for future college students), I faced a significant setback when I received a failing grade on a crucial exam in a class that I had always done fairly well in.

A failure.

That's exactly how I felt.

I let my parents down and more importantly, myself. Overwhelmed with insecurity and self-doubt, I went the entire day in shock and questioned how this would affect my future in higher education. Was I even cut out for the academic rigor of college? Before I began to spiral, I sought out comfort from my parents and guidance counselor. With their grace and understanding, they pulled me from the depths of devastation and I quickly realized I would be okay.

Yes, a failing grade on an important exam is crushing, but I could work hard and tutor for the rest of the school year to prevent it from happening again and save my grade in the class.

I realized that failures are a part of life and that it is how we react to them that determines our success. I also learned the importance of seeking help and support from others. By working with my teacher and tutor, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the subject and improve my grades. And, of course, I learned to persevere in the face of adversity, no matter how big my problem seemed at the current moment. This experience was a turning point in my high school career and helped to shape the person I am today. I am grateful for the lessons I learned and the growth that came from this challenge.
